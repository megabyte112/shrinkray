 A tool for shrinking videos to be under a user-defined size.
 
 This was originally intended for shrinking videos to be under 8MB so that they can be sent in Discord, but can be used for anything requiring video compression.
 It can also download videos from many sites, including YouTube and Reddit.
 
There are many settings within the Python file that area available to edit, to customise shrinkray to the user's needs.
This includes an audio-only mode where only the audio is encoded, and a "meme mode", where videos are encoded at a comically low bitrate.
