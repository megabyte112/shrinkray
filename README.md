# shrinkray
 A tool for shrinking videos to be under a user-defined size.
 This is good for shrinking videos to be under 8MB so that they can be sent in Discord.
 It can also download videos from many sites, including YouTube and Reddit.

# Usage
 If you are downloading a video:
 
    - Open shrinkray
    
    - Paste the video link
    
    - Enter the desired filesize in MB
    
    - Wait for the magic to happen

 If you already have a video:
 
    - Drag the video onto the shrinkray file
    
    - Enter the desired filesize in MB
    
    - Wait for the magic to happen

# Installation
 You must install [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) and [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp).
 
 Either add them to PATH, or create a 'bin' folder with the ffmpeg, ffprobe, and yt-dlp binaries inside.
